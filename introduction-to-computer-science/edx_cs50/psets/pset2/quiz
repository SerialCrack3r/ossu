How does a while loop differ from a do-while loop? When is the latter particularly useful?

while loop is a entry-controlled loop, it first check the condition then enter the body
do-while loop first enter the body and then check the condition.

the most important difference between while loop and do-while loop is that in do-while loop, the block of code is executed at least once.

=====
What does "undeclared identifier" usually indicate if outputted by clang?

the most often it indicate of forgetting to include the header file that contains the function declaration, for example, <cs50.h> for getstring function.

=====
Why is the Caesar Cipher not very secure?

the key space is very small.
using a brute force method, one could easily try all (25) possible combinations in order to decrypt the message without initially knowing the key.

=====
What's a function?

in programming, function a named section of a program that performs a specific task like GetString from
cs50.h

=====
Why bother writing functions when you can just copy and paste code as needed?

if programming there is a principle don't repeat yourself (DRY), and functions help you with it.
it means that you can write good function once and use it forever in different project and not to rewrite it every time. it help you to save a lot of time.
